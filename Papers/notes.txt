Steps to implement 2nd baseline:
- extract for each player in the scene predictions 
    - we need to test the dataexgtraction and preprocessing for player level

    Create annotation processing class
    dataset class fecthing the image and transforms, dataset return one image
    input size may cause problem 
    so we need other function that take the path and return labels
- stack these predications and feed them into nn
- we can try adding Fc after the feature extractor direcly or add it after pooling layer
