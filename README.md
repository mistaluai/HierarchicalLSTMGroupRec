# HierarchicalLSTMGroupRec
This repo implements a two-stage LSTM-based model for group activity recognition. It first captures individual action dynamics and then aggregates them to recognize group-level activities. Evaluated on the Collective Activity and Volleyball datasets, the model outperforms baseline methods in performance.
